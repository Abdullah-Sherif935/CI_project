# XOR Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a simple neural network from scratch using NumPy to solve the XOR problem.  
No machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow / PyTorch) were used.

The implementation includes:
- Dense (Fully Connected) layers  
- Tanh activation  
- Mean Squared Error loss  
- Forward and backward propagation  
- Numerical gradient checking  
- Training the model inside a Jupyter Notebook
